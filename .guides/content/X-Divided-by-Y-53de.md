|||challenge

Write a program that divides X by Y and outputs the result rounded down to the nearest whole number. 

**You may NOT use the `DIV` instruction** so you will have to figure out a clever way of managing it.

You should create 2 DAT variables 

- `X` for the numerator
- `Y` for the denominator

and test your program by setting these numbers to whatever you like.

You should choose values for X and Y where 

- both X and Y should be positive values and 
- Y is not 0

Your program does not have to cater for invalid values, although you can validate the input if you like.

If the validation fails, output `-1`.

When you're done, press the button below.
