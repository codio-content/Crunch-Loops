Let's say we want to add up every number between 1 and 10. From the last example it should be clear that you need to use a loop to count from 1 to 10.

However, we have to maintain the current total as we progress through the loop.

Take a look at the flow chart below. This describes the algorithm. Doing this helps us better visualise the steps before we write the code.
