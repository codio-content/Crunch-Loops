Counters are something you will need to fully understand no matter what programming language you are using.

## Example
Take a look at the code on the left hand side. It is a very simple example and counts from 1 to 10, outputting each value along the way.

In this very simple case, we are using the Accumulator as a counter. Once it gets to 10, the program terminates.

## Step through it
Step through the code on the left and make sure you see what is happening.

This is the simplest possible example for a counter. However, very rarely can we get away with using the Accumulator as a counter. We'll see on the next page how we use a counter variable instead.
